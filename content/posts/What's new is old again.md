[Enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) has lead the web astray. The tightly centralized, corporate web has been spiraling out of control. Everything is content, everything is reactions, everything is "a following", everything is influencing. It given rise to algorithms that reinforce political and ideological echo chambers to the point of violence. People self-censor their speech, even in the real world, because they are so intertwined with the digital world.

I actually decided I had about enough of it many years before writing this post. In 2017, I quit Facebook. Not long after, I stopped posting on Twitter, Tumblr, and various other sites. I would delete old posts and scrub my profiles from search engines. I would invoke my right to be forgotten, and decided I would just stay on the pockets of the web where the old ways lived on.

But even then, many sites and forums shut down after years of operation. Thriving communities became ghost towns. Exacerbated by the AI craze and its crawlers, sites went dark, RSS feeds stopped updating, and Cloudflare became the bouncer for the web.

At this point, I've decided enough is enough and have created a Web 1.0 response to this twisted and distorted Internet. I've discovered things like the Fediverse, IndieWeb, and Smolweb, and I've just started to dip my toes in the water.

This is my first step towards rediscovering a web that is strengthened by sovereignty, interoperability, and decentralization. Here you will find no JavaScript, no `iframe`, no trackers, no ads, no cookies, no captchas. You can read what I write in whatever way you choose.

Technology changes but hopefully the people stick around that make things worth while.
